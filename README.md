Hello, here is my project management tool internship project with Codsoft.

Though everything is working, i have been having a hard time deployin the project on free hosting site like render. So i plead that a little more time be given to me to figure out a solution.

If however you are cloning this project:

Try
npm install  ---- to install all node_modules and dependencies

cd to frontend directory abd run
npm run start  --- this will start up the react front end.

cd to backend directory and run
nodemon app.js --- this will start up the server side.


Thank you
