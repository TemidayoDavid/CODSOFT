Hello, here is my project management tool internship project with Codsoft.

I have finally been able to deploy the app!! Yay.

Try it here
https://codsoft-1-bpbc.onrender.com/

If however you are cloning this project:

Try
npm install  ---- to install all node_modules and dependencies

cd to frontend directory abd run
npm run start  --- this will start up the react front end.

cd to backend directory and run
nodemon app.js --- this will start up the server side.



Thank you
